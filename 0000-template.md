# Summary

Short explanation of the proposal.

# Motivation

Why are we doing this? What use cases does it support? What is the expected outcome?

# Explanation

Explain the proposal as if it was already included in the language and you were teaching it to a user. That generally means:

- Introducing new named concepts.
- Explaining the feature largely in terms of examples.
- Explaining how users should *think* about the feature, and how it should impact the way they use ProseMirror. It should explain the impact as concretely as possible.

# Drawbacks and alternatives

Why should we *not* do this?

Consider the feature's interaction with other features, what open issues there are in implementing it, and how it should behave in corner cases.

What other designs have been considered and what is the rationale for not choosing them?
